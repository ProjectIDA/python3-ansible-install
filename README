Here is a procedure Iâ€™ve developed for installing python 3.7 along side the system python on RHEL/Centos 7. It is Ansible based, but as you can see, can easily be turned into a simple shell scripts.

Ansible inventory: idadcc7-inv
Ansible playbook : py37-install.yaml

If you have Ansible installed on your local system and these files in the current working directory, you may perform the install on host idadcc7.ucsd.edu with the following:

shell-prompt> ansible-playbook -i idadcc7-inv --ask-become-pass py37-install.yaml
